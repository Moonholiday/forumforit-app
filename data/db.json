So what I am trying to do is to modify a packet which is send from my client to the server. Although the communication is not really encrypted I somehow can't get it to work... UDP is used. Here is a snippet of the data (only the data) :Spoiler (Click to View)The data shows a transfer of a shovel from inventory A -> B.What I want to do is to modify that packet, so it would transfer 2 shovels even if I only have one. Or to do the transfer even if I have no shovel.If you have any idea how I could make this work or why it won't work, I would be very grateful to know."
