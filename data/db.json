I'm having quite an issue that I cannot find a fix to, and after hours of googling and trying out tutorials and everything else, I'm at a complete loss. I used to use a cracked version of Adobe products (IE After Effects, Photoshop, and Illustrator), and after getting into a graphic design class in college, I decided to purchase the Adobe suite with all Adobe products to help me further my education legally, but my issue comes when trying to uninstall the cracked adobe products and reinstalling the valid adobe products. Every time I try and uninstall CC and the cracked products, an _error_ pops up \"CRLoggerTransport.exe cannot be run\" and \"AdobeIPC.exe cannot be run\". I've manually deleted every adobe file on my PC, but when I go to reinstall CC or any adobe products through my valid license on the website, these errors constantly pop up again. Like I said, I couldn't find a working fix for me and was wondering if any of y'all could possibly provide me with a bit of information or maybe a fix. Thanks :)\nCan I get some help on this please? I'm sure someone knows this issue and how to fix it...",
